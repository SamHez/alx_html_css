# SmileSchool – Advanced HTML & CSS Project

## 📖 Overview

SmileSchool is a static, responsive website built as part of the **HTML Advanced** curriculum. The goal of this project is to faithfully reproduce a designer-provided layout (via Figma) using **only HTML and CSS**, while following best practices for structure, semantics, accessibility, and code quality.

This phase of the project focuses primarily on **CSS styling**, layout techniques, and visual accuracy rather than JavaScript functionality.

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this project, you will demonstrate the ability to:

* Structure a complete webpage using **semantic HTML5**
* Apply advanced **CSS styling and layout techniques**
* Translate a **Figma design** into pixel-accurate code
* Maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code
* Respect **W3C standards** and validation rules
* Build a website without external frameworks or libraries

## 🎨 Design Reference

The design for this project is provided via **Figma**.

* Fonts used in the design:

  * **Source Sans Pro**
  * **Spin Cycle OT**

If these fonts are not installed locally, they can be downloaded from:

* [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
* [https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)

> Some measurements in Figma use floating-point values — rounding is acceptable.
